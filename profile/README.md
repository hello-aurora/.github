## Hi here,

We are two passionates building the best mobile application for Northern Lights lovers. I've open sourced two projects that I'm using to parse climate data through our api and worker.

- [Heroku buildpack for CDO](https://github.com/hello-aurora/cdo): ["Climate Data Operators"](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/) is one of the most popular library to manipulate Climate and NWP model Data. This library enables bindings through heroku.
- [Heroku build for ecCodes](https://github.com/hello-aurora/eccodes): ["ecCodes"](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/ECC/) contains a set of tools to mainly manipulate GRIB data. This library enables bindings through heroku. ecCodes is also includes inside the CDO buildpack.
